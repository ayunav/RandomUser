## Description 

This app displays the information, a name and an image, about random users on the internet. 

The thumbnail is loaded in the background and is stored in the local file system after it has been retrieved from the network.

If a thumbnail has already been loaded from the network and is available from the local file system, then it loads from the local file system.
