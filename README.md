# RandomUser


- load data from JSON file at path 
- The JSON file should be loaded from the network when the app starts. Display an appropriate loading indicator as it loads. 

- The thumbnail should be loaded in the background, and be stored on the local file system after it has been retrieved from the network.
- If a thumbnail has already be loaded from the network and is available from the local file system, then it should load from the local file system. 
- Animate the display of the thumbnail into the table view cell (use whatever animation you’d like). 
- Only the thumbnail for each visible cell should loaded (i.e. don’t preemptively load all thumbnails from the network on the view appearing). 

- add nav controller with nav bar. nav bar title - random user  
- customize layout of the table view cell 
- Optionally make the app look as slick as you’d like (use your judgement here).
